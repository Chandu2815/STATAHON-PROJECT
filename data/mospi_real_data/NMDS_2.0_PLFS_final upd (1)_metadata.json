        "PLFS covers the whole of the Indian Union except the villages in Andaman and Nicobar Islands which are difficult to access throughout the year. Population coverage.\n\nThe coverage of population in the survey are determined with the following guidelines:1. Under-trial prisoners in jails and indoor patients of hospitals, nursing homes etc., are to be excluded, but residential staff therein will be listed while listing is done in such institutions. The persons of the first category will be considered as normal members of their parent households and will be counted there. Convicted prisoners undergoing sentence will be outside the coverage of the survey.2. Floating population, i.e., persons without any normal residence will not be listed. But households residing in open space, roadside shelter, under a bridge, etc., more or less regularly in the same place, will be listed.3. Foreign nationals will not be listed, nor their domestic servants, if by definition the latter belong to the foreign national's household. If, however, a foreign national becomes an Indian citizen for all practical purposes, he or she will be covered. 4. Persons residing in barracks of military and paramilitary forces (like police, BSF, etc.) will be kept outside the survey coverage due to difficulty in conduct of survey therein. However, civilian population residing in their neighborhood, including the family quarters of service personnel, are to be covered. Permission for this may have to be obtained from appropriate authorities.5. Orphanages, rescue homes, ashrams and vagrant houses are outside the survey coverage. However, persons staying in old age homes, students staying in ashrams/ hostels and the residential staff (other than monks/ nuns) of these ashrams may be listed. For orphanages, although orphans are not to be listed, the persons looking after them and staying there may be considered for listing. "
